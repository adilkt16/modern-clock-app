# Privacy Policy — AltRise Clock (Modern Clock App)

Effective Date: November 5, 2025

## Overview
AltRise Clock ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. We do not collect, store, or share personal data on our servers. All alarm data and preferences remain on your device.

## Information We Collect
We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII). The app stores only the data required for alarm functionality, locally on your device:
- Alarm configurations (time, label, repeat options, end time)
- App preferences (theme, UI settings)

No account is required. No cloud sync is performed. We do not transmit your data to any external server.

## How We Use Your Data
- Schedule and trigger alarms reliably, even if the device is locked or sleeping
- Show alarm notifications and an over-the-app alarm screen so you can dismiss alarms
- Remember your preferences and improve your in‑app experience

## Permissions We Request
The app requests only the permissions necessary for alarm functionality:
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` — to show alarm notifications (Android 13+)
- `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` / `USE_EXACT_ALARM` — to ring alarms at the exact time
- `WAKE_LOCK` — to briefly wake the device so alarms can ring
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` (+ special use subtype) — to run a foreground service while an alarm is active
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` — to restore alarms after the device restarts
- `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` (Display over other apps) — to show a full‑screen alarm overlay so you can quickly solve the puzzle or dismiss the alarm
- `VIBRATE` — to provide haptic feedback and alarm vibration (if enabled)

These permissions are used only for their stated purposes and can be controlled in your device settings.

## Data Storage & Sharing
- All alarm data is stored locally on your device.
- We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.
- We do not use third‑party analytics or advertising SDKs in this app.

## Security
We apply reasonable technical measures to protect data stored locally by the app. Please protect your device with a passcode or biometric lock to prevent unauthorized access.

## Children’s Privacy
This app is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Your Choices
- You may revoke granted permissions at any time in your device’s Settings.
- You may delete the app to remove all locally stored data.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy as our app evolves or to comply with legal requirements. We will update the “Effective Date” above when changes are made.
