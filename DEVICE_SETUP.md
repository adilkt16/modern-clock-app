# ðŸ“± Device Authorization Required

## Current Status:
Your device `00055342M003541` is connected but shows as **"unauthorized"**.

## âœ… Steps to Fix This:

### 1. **Check Your Device Screen**
   - Look for a popup dialog on your Android device
   - It should say something like "Allow USB Debugging?"
   - The dialog might show: "The computer's RSA key fingerprint is: ..."

### 2. **Authorize the Connection**
   - âœ… **Check the box** "Always allow from this computer" 
   - âœ… **Tap "OK"** or "Allow"

### 3. **If You Don't See the Dialog:**
   - Unplug the USB cable
   - Plug it back in
   - The authorization dialog should appear

### 4. **Alternative Method:**
   - Go to **Settings** â†’ **Developer Options**
   - Find **"Revoke USB debugging authorizations"**
   - Tap it to clear previous settings
   - Reconnect your device

## ðŸ”„ After Authorization:
Once you authorize the connection, run this command to verify:
```bash
adb devices
```

You should see:
```
List of devices attached
00055342M003541    device
```
(Instead of "unauthorized", it should show "device")

## ðŸš€ Then Test the App:
```bash
cd /home/user/Desktop/projects/alone/ClockApp
./test-device.sh
```

**The dialog usually appears automatically when you connect - check your device screen now! ðŸ“±**
